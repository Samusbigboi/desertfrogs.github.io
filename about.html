      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Wilmer Nyman — an artist and IT-technician passionate about creating, 
        experimenting, and exploring new systems. My work spans from digital automation 
        to creative projects that combine technology and art.

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My journey bridges technology and creativity. I design workflows, build scripts, 
      and tinker with systems like NixOS and n8n for automation. At the same time, 
      I enjoy making visual art that explores form, color, and contrast. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m always curious — whether it’s learning a new programming language, 
      experimenting with automation, or sketching concepts that merge 
      technology and aesthetics.
