      <h1>The Game Project</h1>
      <p>
        Heavily inspired by the King's Field and Shadow Tower series by FromSoftware, with King's Field being their first ever game.
        This project is done solo by me using Godot as the engine, and Blender for all 3D.

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My journey bridges technology and creativity. I design workflows, build scripts, 
      and tinker with systems like NixOS and n8n, as well as working solo-dev on a game. 
      At the same time, I enjoy making visual art that explores form, color, and contrast. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m always curious, whether it’s learning a new programming language, 
      experimenting with automation, or sketching concepts that merge 
      technology and aesthetics.
