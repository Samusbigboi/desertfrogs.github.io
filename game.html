      <h1>The Game Project</h1>
      <p>
        Heavily inspired by the King's Field and Shadow Tower series by FromSoftware, with King's Field being their first ever game.
        This project is done solo by me using Godot as the engine, and Blender for all 3D.

    <h2>Not a programmer</h2>
    <p>
      I don't consider myself a programmer. I can't write my own code. However, like many others, I'm able to frankenstein myself through the code. <br>
      Having a vision, and understanding for the most part what the code means really helps. I know somewhat how the systems and mechanics would be structured, <br>
      and I know what scope is too big for me at the moment. So looking for what I want, YouTube and various forum posts is how I do it. <br>
      However, I need to figure out how to make different systems work with each other, and that's always a fun puzzle to complete. it gives me a great feeling of accomplishment. <br>
      The easier part would be to find a programmer that would do it for me, and I could focus on the visuals, which is what i want to do, but then I'll have to adapt to someone else. <br>

    <p>
      I was contemplating using other engines, such as Unity, or Unreal.. But the UX of Unity is horrendous, and Unreal is a bloated piece of crap. <br>
      Using Linux, specifically NixOS, also played a big role. Unreal is a pain to get working properly, and Unity is just out of the question in the first place. <br>
      Godot is a lot more narrow in what it can do, so there are way less crap to waddle through for my simple project. <br>
      I'm also thinking about switching over to the engine that King's Field used, which is Sword of Moonlight, but maybe for my next project.
